1 - hero section with logo and navbar (desktop first)
    challenge was to fit the image with the correct size, solution was::
        bg-img {  
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: bottom;
            min-height: 50vh;
        }
    - also add difficulty adding the font family (I was not adding the @import on the top of the CSS file)

2 - 6card section ( desktop first TRY TO ALREADY MAKE MOBILE)
    was hard to fit the grid inside the container without moving it with content inside.
    Solutionw was::
        #cards-container {
            display:grid;
            grid-template-columns: 50% 50% ;
            align-items: auto;
        }

3 - 6card section ( add images and formating p's)
    fit img inside the grid with::
        background-position: center;
        /* background-repeat: no-repeat; */
        background-size: cover;
    -still need to undestand about the underline on "LEAN MORE" 
    -P font weight (NEED TO double check)
    - Make responsiveness (2nd)

4 - Testimonials section 
    - Flex box centered with a title and 3 sections 
    - testimonials section responsive 
    - PROBLEM to fix mobile version (brave is crashing everytime, going back to FIREFOX??)
 
5 - 4card section 
    - 4imgafes grid responsive done
    - had to change the width of container in order to match de design 

6 - Footer Section::
    - logo
    - 3xa 
    - 4x social icons 

7 - TOOGLE + HOVER 
    - made toogle menu hamburger button 
        {couldnt figure it out how to add transation to the toogle so then I was able to solve it adding.... }
    - it was hard to make the menu mobile close when window is adjusted (onresize()), i solve it with::
        window.onresize = function() {
            if (this.window.innerWidth >= 800){
            var menu = document.getElementById("menu")
            menu.classList.add("hidden")  
            }
        };

8 - Make Hover status (was hard to find how to add transparency to the background of the navbar button, solve it with background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%, 0.1); (last value means the transparency))
  - Make triangle (done)
