1 - hero section with logo and navbar (desktop first)
    challenge was to fit the image with the correct size, solution was::
        bg-img {  
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: bottom;
            min-height: 50vh;
        }
    - also add difficulty adding the font family (I was not adding the @import on the top of the CSS file)

2 - 6card section ( desktop first TRY TO ALREADY MAKE MOBILE)
    was hard to fit the grid inside the container without moving it with content inside.
    Solutionw was::
        #cards-container {
            display:grid;
            grid-template-columns: 50% 50% ;
            align-items: auto;
        }

3 - 6card section ( add images and formating p's)
    fit img inside the grid with::
        background-position: center;
        /* background-repeat: no-repeat; */
        background-size: cover;
    -still need to undestand about the underline on "LEAN MORE" 
    -P font weight (NEED TO double check)
